# Coding Task

To complete the task, I first thought of a concept.
To make the process easier for me, I chose JavaScript, a simple language that is easy to understand.

The first thing I knew was necessary is the main body loop itself.
In this, I thought for about 5 minutes about how to exactly do it.

After having a function for looping and printing the main body to the console, 
I just had to implement a boolean check to determine if a star is needed. Following that, 
I had to write one line for the end of the tree.

So, my programming task was completed in around 15 minutes.

Before I fully finished, I uploaded it to Github.
